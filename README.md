# me.

This page contains some basic information about me. 
And pointers to not-so-basic information.

## What my passport says

My name is Tim Weber, I was born in 1983 in Mannheim, Germany.

I currently live in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, but that's about to change soon: 
I'll be moving into a van and travel Europe and the world. 
More on that [further down the page](#van-life).

## On social media

I'm **scy** on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scy) and [GitHub](https://github.com/scy).

I have a Facebook account, but I don't really use it and therefore I won't link to it. 
I don't use Instagram or Snapchat.

I am an active but casual [Guild Wars 2](https://www.guildwars2.com/) player; if you want to hang out, contact me to get my account name.

## What I do

By profession, I'm a software engineer, currently doing Go and PHP back-end development at [FastBill](https://www.fastbill.com/).

I'm also interested in photography, electronic music, amateur radio (not licensed yet though) as well as lean and agile thinking.

You can head over to [my knowledge repo](https://github.com/scy/knowledge), where I'm publicly writing down things that I've learned and/or found interesting.

## Van life

I'm currently transitioning to live full time in a custom built camper van. 
You can follow my progress on Twitter ([@timwohnt](https://twitter.com/timwohnt)) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/timwohnt%C3%BCberall), but both are in German only.

The van is called **Jessie** after [the Joshua Kadison song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gre4DZuA6k4), and it has [its own GitHub repository](https://github.com/scy/jessie) containing software, documentation and thoughts about all the things that Jessie is and is going to be.

There's a [public Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=djkcq7p83b256jq6fj1j1fov4s%40group.calendar.google.com) containing my planned(!) trips and stays.
